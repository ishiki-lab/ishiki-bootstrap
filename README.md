# ishiki-bootstrap
Script and resources to build the ishiki sd card image

## Install using prepared image

### Get and burn OS image

* Get the latest image from lush_sd_images in the secrets folder
* Get [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) to burn it with
* Burn image to a mini SD card for use in Pi


### Boot it up

* Put the sd card in the pi
* Plug the USB drive into the pi
* Turn pi on
* Wait
* You might need to restart it the first time if it doesn't find the wifi


## Create a Fresh Raspian Base Image

### Get and burn OS image

* Get the [latest raspian image](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_lite_latest)
* Get [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) to burn it with
* Burn image to mini SD card for use in Pi

### Configure Pi for wifi/ssh access

Raspbian has some built in magic to help configure sd cards directly.
Mount the flashed SD card on your PC and add two files to the boot folder

* An empty file called `ssh`, this will turn on sshd
* Copy the `wpa_supplicant.conf` file from the `boot` folder of this repo and update it with the ssis and psk of your local wifi.
* Determine the ip address of the pi, either by booting with a screen attatched,
working on a network where the host broadcast works or other devious means.


### Install local requirements

* Clone this repo locally
* Create python 3 virtualenv
* Install requirements.txt: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Configure card build

for ishiki card

* Copy `config_local.py` from secrets into the root of the repo
* Edit your new local `config_local.py` to add the ip address of the pi
* Copy the whole folder `secrets` in next to the root of this repo

for lushroom card

* Rename config_local_lush.py to config_local.py
* Manually edit the USERNAME at the top of bootstrap.bootstrap.py to "lush"
* Edit your new local `config_local.py` to add the ip address of the pi and a password to use
* create a folder called secrets next to the root of this repo and put the lrpi_id_rsa in there

### Build card with Fabric script

* In terminal cd to the root of this repo
* Run `fab prepare --screen=<screen_name>`. screen_name can be `waveshare` or `kedei`: these screen names refer to the [waveshare 3.5" model B](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/3.5inch_RPi_LCD_(B)) and [kedei 3.5"](http://kedei.net/raspberry/raspberry.html) touchscreens for the Raspberry Pi.
* Wait for pi to reboot and settle down. NB the current build may take a long time building libsodium from source - just wait.
* Run second part of build (mode can be dev or prod) `fab finish --mode=<mode> --screen=<screen_name>`. mode can be either `dev` or `prod`, screen_name can be `waveshare` or `kedei`,
* Wait for pi to finish installing things and shut itself down
* Remove the sd card from pi and take a copy of the image with `dd` something
 like `sudo dd if=/dev/rdisk2 of=/Users/paul/Documents/lush_prod.img bs=1m` but with a path on your machine
* Optionally shrink the image, for instance with `https://github.com/qrti/shrink`


### Create Lushroom stand alone SD card image

Take the card image as created above and burn to a 16GB card.
Start with your usual dev setting.json but without a docker-compose.yml.
Log in and pull down the docker images used by the stand alone configuration

* lushdigital/lushroom-captive-portal:latest
* dperson/samba:armhf
* lushdigital/lushroom-display:staging
* lushdigital/lushroom-player:staging
* lushdigital/lushroom-brickd:latest

Then shutdown and copy card using dd as above. This is not taking advantage of the resizing for this card.
Ideally It sould be done on a 4GB card with resizing reenabled.

The content of the stand alone `settings.json` is minimal:

```
{
    "name": "lushroom",
    "host_name": "lushroom",
    "time_zone": "Europe/London",
    "captive_portal": true
}
```

and the `docker-compose.yaml` should be:

```
version: '3'

services:
  captive-portal:
    container_name: captive-portal
    image: lushdigital/lushroom-captive-portal:latest
